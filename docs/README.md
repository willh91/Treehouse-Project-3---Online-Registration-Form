Online Registration Form

I am going for Exceeds Expectation on this project.

Everything should be working properly. The only problem I had was when I ran my css through the validator it said it didn't realize the pseudo-class or pseudo-element. It is on line 109 but it works exactly how I need it to and it works on many internet browsers.


Otherwise everything went smoothly and again everything should be completed according to the guidelines.
